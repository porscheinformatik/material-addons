<p>
  A stepper allows to create workflows that divides content into logical steps
</p>
<p>
  This stepper component is based on the CdkStepper implementation.<br>
  Please find the documentation here: <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/stepper/overview" title="CdkStepper">CdkStepper</a><br>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Use When</h2>
<ul>
  <li>work processes may not fit in one viewport</li>
  <li>creation of workflows and separation of content into logical steps is needed</li>
  <li>there is a linear workflow</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<ul>
  <li>initially the first step is open</li>
  <li>steps can be accessed either through the navigation button inside the step or by clicking on the step header</li>
  <li>moving to the next step is only possible when the current step is completed/valid</li>
  <li>steps are highlighted if they are valid/completed or invalid</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Linear stepper</h2>
<p>
  The stepper only allows a linear processing of the steps. The user has to complete the previous steps before
  proceeding.
  For each step, the stepControl attribute has to be set which is used to check the validity of the step.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
  The stepper implementation already takes care of the navigation of the stepper. A step can either be accessed by the
  button inside the step or by clicking on the header.
  Alternatively, there is the possibility to define the navigation by using onNext/onDone/onHeaderClick.
  Then the navigation has to be triggered manually. You can use the @ViewChild() annotation to get a reference of your
  StepperComponent,
  which allows you to call the following method:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    next() - navigate to the next step
  </li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>
  Import the
  <app-text-code>StepperModule</app-text-code>
  in your app.module.ts and use it via
  <app-text-code>&lt;mad-stepper&gt;</app-text-code>
  .
